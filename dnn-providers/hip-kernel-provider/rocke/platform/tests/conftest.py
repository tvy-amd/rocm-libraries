    Under ``both`` the dispatcher refuses to substitute the Python result for a
    kernel the C++ engine could not lower, so an arch with no C++ ISA backend
    (see ``backend.CPP_UNPORTED_ARCHES``) raises ``BackendCoverageGap``. Turning
    it into a skip here keeps the gap *counted and named* in the run summary.
    Letting it pass -- which is what returning the Python IR would do -- would
    make the differential lane green on kernels it never compared.

    Only ``BackendCoverageGap`` is remapped. A ``BackendMismatch`` (the engines
    disagreed) and any other engine error stay failures.

    This rewrites the report rather than the raised exception because most of
    the suite is ``unittest.TestCase``: pytest's unittest integration captures
    the error inside ``runtest()`` and only republishes it onto ``call.excinfo``
    from its own (tryfirst, non-wrapper) makereport hook, so a
    ``pytest_runtest_call`` wrapper sees no exception at all and silently does
    nothing. Wrapping makereport is the one place that sees both styles.
