"""Golden IR byte-stability gate for an installed rocKE package.

This is the host-only (no GPU) golden test for the provider CI lane. It rebuilds
the representative IR cases from the installed ``rocke`` package, hashes the
Python-lowered LLVM IR for every llvm flavor the golden holds -- the flavor is
an argument to lowering, so the host's own ROCm vintage does not limit what can
be checked -- and compares the digests to the committed golden. Any drift means
emitted IR changed.

It is intended to run directly from an installed staging prefix, co-located with
the ``rocke`` package, the ``rocke_ir_parity_harness`` module, and the golden
JSON under ``golden/``. It fixes up ``sys.path`` before importing anything, so
RockCI can execute it from a staged test artifact:

  python rocke_installed_golden.py
