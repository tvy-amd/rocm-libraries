"""Attention / FMHA dispatcher family (path-level selection).

Worked implementation mirroring :mod:`rocke.dispatch.gemm.bf16_rcr`, backed by
:mod:`kernels.common.attention_unified` (the unified tiled FMHA emitter).

This module owns only the assembly: the registry, the entry points, and the
re-exports that make ``dispatch.attention`` one import for callers. What each
candidate *is* lives in the arch module that owns it. See :mod:`.common` for
the scope of the dispatch decision and what it deliberately defers.

Registration is explicit rather than an import side effect, so the registry
contents are a readable list, a test can assemble a registry from a subset of
arch modules, and adding an arch touches exactly one line here.
