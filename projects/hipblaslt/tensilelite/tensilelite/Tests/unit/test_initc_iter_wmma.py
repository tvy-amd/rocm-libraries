"""Unit tests for the InitCIterWmma unrolled-loop entry threshold.

``KernelWriterAssembly.unrollLoopEntryEndCounter`` is the single source shared
by openLoop's loop-entry guard and initC's InitCIterWmma v_mov skip-branch: the
main (global-load) unrolled loop -- and therefore the cloned iter0 that zeroes C
-- runs iff ``LoopCounter > T``. The skip-branch must use the same ``T`` so the
v_mov is skipped exactly when the loop (and its WMMA-based C init) will run.
