"""Mutation-killing characterization test for ``_validateChipId``.

Pins the current end-to-end behavior of the top-level chip-ID validator across
its five reachable outcomes. The module is imported by dotted path
(``from Tensile.TensileLogic.ValidChipId import _validateChipId``) so that each
call is routed through the mutmut trampoline; the sibling ``test_ValidChipId.py``
loads the module with ``importlib.spec_from_file_location`` against the source
path, which bypasses the trampoline and therefore never exercises the mutants.

Each test drives one branch/return site and asserts the exact return value and
the exact ``stderr`` text the function emits today (via ``_reportChipIdFailure``).
Behavior is pinned as it runs now, including two non-obvious facts a later
refactor would have to revisit:

  * ``_extractArchInfo`` rejects an empty Device list before ``_validateChipId``
    ever reaches its own ``not arch_info.DeviceIds`` guard, so that guard's
    reporting branch is unreachable dead code today.
  * an invalid device predicate surfaces through the *inner* ``except
    (LogicFileError, ValueError)`` as ``ValidChipId failed (ValueError): ...``,
    not through the extract-time ``except LogicFileError``.
